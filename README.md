# R-Programming-Final-Project
This is the final project for my R-Programming course through George Mason University.
It uses coronavirus data from Johns Hopkins University and creates multiple graphs comparing multiple countries.
Below is a description of each of the graphs created using R-Markdown and ggplot.
  Graph 1 - Compares the new cases per day between the US, India, and Chile
  Graph 2 - Compares the new deaths per day between the US, the UK, and Russia
  Graph 3 - Compares the new recoveries per day between the US, Brazil, and Peru.
  Graph 4 - Plotting the peak cases for each country.
  Graph 5 - Plotting the peak deaths for each country.
  Graph 6 - Plotting the peak recoveries for each country.
  Graph 7 - Comparing the New Cases of Countries on the Date of the US's Peak of New Cases.
